1. **Set Up**
   - Gather all the tools (PyTorch, torchvision, etc.) you’ll need.
   - Decide on the basics: What are the possible labels (male/female)? How many photos per batch? How many times will the model learn from the data? How fast should it learn? And will you use a GPU or just your computer’s CPU?

2. **Prep Your Photos**
   - For training, give your images a makeover: randomly flip, twist, or brighten them so the model doesn’t get bored and learns to recognize faces in all sorts of ways.
   - For checking if the model is learning (validation/testing), just resize and tidy up the images—no need for fancy transformations here.

3. **Load the Model**
   - Start with a ResNet18 model that already has some experience with image recognition.
   - Replace its last part so it can just decide between “male” and “female.”
   - Send it to the device you chose (GPU or CPU).

4. **Train the model**
   - Load your images into the program from training and validation folders.
   - If you have more of one gender than the other, make sure the model pays extra attention to the underrepresented group by giving those images more “weight” during learning.
   - Get the images ready in batches for both training and validation.
   - Set the rules for learning (the loss function) and how the model updates itself (the optimizer).
   - For each round (epoch):
     - Show the model batches of photos, let it guess, and then tell it where it was wrong so it can get better.
     - After each round, check how well it’s doing on the validation photos.
     - If it’s getting better, save its current “brain.”
   - When done, save the best version of the model (like a high score).
   - See how well your best model did on validation: print stats showing how often it was right, and display a confusion matrix to see where it got confused.

5. **Final Test**
   - Load up your test images (new, unseen by the model).
   - Bring back the best “brain” you saved earlier.
   - Let the model make predictions on the test images.
   - Print out a final report and show another confusion matrix so you know exactly how well it did.

6. **Done**
   - Make sure you set the right folder paths for your training, validation, and test images.
   - First, train your model and remember which label is which.
   - Then, test the model on new images and see how well it learned to tell the difference between genders.
